      <title><![CDATA[The Dunning-Kruger Effect]]></title>
      <url>https://biozcw.github.io/2017/03/07/The-Dunning-kRUGER-Effect/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever asked yourself a question like this? Why do idiots think they are geniuses? Or, in other words, are stupid people too stupid to realise they are stupid? Do stupid people walk up to a mirror, and look into that mirror, to see a genius?</p>
<p>Many great thinkers in our history had similar concerns. It’s start to look like something might be true here, that “<strong>ignorance is bliss</strong>“</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Real knowledge is to know the extent of one’s ignorance.</strong> – Confucius 551-479 BC</p>
<p><strong>I know nothing except the fact of my ignorance.</strong> – Plato 428-348 BC</p>
<p><strong>The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.</strong> – William Shakespeare 1564-1616</p>
<p><strong>Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.</strong> – Charles Darwin 1809-1882</p>
<p><strong>One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are stupid, and those with any imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and indecision.</strong> – Bertrand Russell 1872-1970</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So enter David Dunning and Justin Kruger, as they actually decided to test this scientifically. A number of tests were given to the subjects, and subjects were then asked to assess their abilities. Sure enough, poor performers over-estimated their performance by a large margin (30%-50%). The study also revealed that the most competent tended to underestimate their relative competence, as they assume the tests much be easy for everyone.</p>
<p>Later studies revealed that poor performers do not understand that they need to improve, even with feedback.</p>
<p>So it seems, practice makes you better, confidence itself won’t do.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Housing Ponzi finance]]></title>
      <url>https://biozcw.github.io/2017/02/24/Housing-Ponzi-finance/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I dug deeper into the Australian property market, and learnt more about various irrationalities that the many people tend to slide into, I inevitably come across the phrase “Ponzi Scheme”. (<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/what-is-a-ponzi-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/what-is-a-ponzi-scheme/</a>)</p>
<p>Whether Ponzi finance has infiltrated the housing market? According to Pete Wargent, a prominent Sydney housing investor, the answer may very much be positive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bubbles occur when market reach a stage of Ponzi finance: income flows cover neither principal nor interest charges, and owners become completely reliant on escalating sale prices (capital gains) to make a profit and meet the cost of the debt.</p>
<p>(However) The concept of a market supported solely by Ponzi finance is fundamentally flawed in the current environment since it incorrectly assumes that every investor in Australia bought their property today (and ignores the role of homeowners in the housing market).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the real situation may never be fully uncovered, it is evident that today’s housing price in Sydney has reached an irrationally high point. To me, a sharp decline in price may be less likely to happen over night, but stagnation of general housing price may soon become an reality. And buying a house for investment right now may not be the best of ideas.</p>

      <url>https://biozcw.github.io/2017/02/24/Five-diseases-of-academic-publishing/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scientists these days are under such immense pressure to “get results” that  the well-being of the academic community is threatened. Here are five diseases of academic publishing suggested by John Antonakis, a well trained psychologist.</p>
<h4 id="Diseases-troubling-the-scientific-community"><a href="#Diseases-troubling-the-scientific-community" class="headerlink" title="Diseases troubling the scientific community"></a>Diseases troubling the scientific community</h4><h5 id="1-significosis"><a href="#1-significosis" class="headerlink" title="1. significosis"></a>1. significosis</h5><p>The sole focus to produce statistically significant results, which is well-known among us scientists. Since players in the publishing game only consider significant results worth publishing, it has introduced bias, including investigator bias, which may lead to the assumption that what is significant has to also be real, or true. (Which is not necessarily the case, as people may eventually get lucky if they just keep trying)</p>
<h5 id="2-Neophilia"><a href="#2-Neophilia" class="headerlink" title="2. Neophilia"></a>2. Neophilia</h5><p>This is about excessive appreciation for novelty that went wrong. Indeed novel finding can be useful, but it may just as likely, if not more likely to be false. Replications of previously published results are deemed boring these days, which is rather disturbing.</p>
<h5 id="3-Theorrhea"><a href="#3-Theorrhea" class="headerlink" title="3. Theorrhea"></a>3. Theorrhea</h5><p>It refers to a mania for new theory. Especially in top journals, research are mean to be theory driven and not exploratory. How is it possible for us to develop so many contributions to theory? Assuming 5 elite journals each producing 80 papers a year, the sheer amount of contributions can be staggering. </p>
<h5 id="4-Arigorium"><a href="#4-Arigorium" class="headerlink" title="4. Arigorium"></a>4. Arigorium</h5><p>A deficiency of rigor in theoretical and empirical work. Theories need to be more precise, realistic, and testable, as oppose to “cheap works” that excel in quantity.</p>
<h5 id="5-Disjunctivitis"><a href="#5-Disjunctivitis" class="headerlink" title="5. Disjunctivitis"></a>5. Disjunctivitis</h5><p>It is about a collective proclivity (tendency) to produce large quantities of redundant, trivial, and incoherent works. This happens mainly because such actions are usually rewarded. The result is a lot of research disjointed from well established body of knowledge. Such stagnant or even backward tendencies is in nature fragmented, and will serve little in the advance of science in a cohesive fashion.</p>
